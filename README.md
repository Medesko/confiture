## 4 - The table Associations:
````
In Rails, an association is a connection between two Active Record models. Associations are implemented using macro-style calls, so that you can declaratively add features to your models. For example, by declaring that one model belongs_to another, you instruct Rails to maintain Primary Keyâ€“Foreign Key information between instances of the two models, and you also get a number of utility methods added to your model. Rails supports six types of associations:

belongs_to
has_one
has_many
has_many :through
has_one :through
has_and_belongs_to_many

## 5 - Running Migrations
